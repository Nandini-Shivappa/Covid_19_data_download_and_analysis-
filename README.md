#  COVID-19 Data Download and Analysis

This project focuses on downloading, processing, and analyzing global COVID-19 data using Python. It includes time-series trend analysis, country-level statistics, and visualization of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.

##  Project Objective

- Automate the download of up-to-date COVID-19 data from trusted sources
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on global and country-specific case trends
- Visualize the spread and impact of COVID-19 over time
- Generate actionable insights for public health monitoring

##  Project File

- `Covid19_data_download_and_analysis.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook that performs data loading, transformation, and visualization.

##  Data Sources

- Data is likely pulled from public repositories like [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) or APIs like:
  - `https://covid19api.com`
  - WHO or ECDC datasets (if applicable)

> **Note:** If you're using live APIs, make sure to cite them in your repo or include a `data/` folder for static versions.

##  Tools & Libraries

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Requests** – For downloading data from APIs (if used)
- **Datetime** – Handling time-series data

##  Key Insights

- Trend analysis of daily and cumulative COVID-19 cases
- Top affected countries by confirmed cases and deaths
- Growth rate comparison across different time periods
- Visualization of the impact curve by country and globally

##  Visualizations

Includes various types of charts:
- Line plots for confirmed, recovered, and death trends
- Bar charts for country-wise comparisons
- Heatmaps for regional impact
- Time-series growth trend visualizations
